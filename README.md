# AutoMarket

A repository for final project. It is an application (AutoMarket) for buying, selling and swapping used vehicles. Users create an account to put up listings. Listings are created by filling out a form with a wide variety of characteristics to choose from, such as the make, model, mileage, color, fuel type, and transmission. The listings include a contact form that potential buyers can use to reach the seller. The app is for both car dealerships and private users. While private user accounts are hidden from others, dealerships have a public user page that includes all their listings and information. The app is created with Expo.
